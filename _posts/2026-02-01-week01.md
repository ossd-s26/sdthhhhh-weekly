Open source communities rely on trust, shared expectations, and open communication. The Code of Conduct activity highlighted how a Code of Conduct helps create a respectful and inclusive environment by clearly defining acceptable behavior and outlining fair enforcement processes that apply to everyone, including maintainers.
The presentation emphasized that transparency is essential for building trust. Open discussions, public decision-making, and documented reasoning help contributors understand not just what decisions are made, but why. Consensus does not require full agreement; it requires respectful dialogue and a willingness to listen.
