### Week 1 Reflection

This week was mainly about getting set up and becoming familiar with the structure of the course and the workflow for using GitHub and Jekyll.

I learned how to clone a repository, edit files locally, and push changes back to GitHub. At first, using Git and the terminal felt a bit confusing, but after practicing the basic commands, the process started to make more sense. Understanding how posts are organized inside the `_posts` folder was especially helpful.

I also set up my personal website and edited my `about.md` page. This was my first time working with a static site generator, and it was interesting to see how Markdown files automatically turn into webpages.

Looking forward to using this site to document my progress and share what I learn in the coming weeks.
