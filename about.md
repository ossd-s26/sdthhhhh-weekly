Hi! 👋 I’m a junior at **New York University**, majoring in **Computer Science** with a minor in **Studio Arts**.

I’m interested in the intersection of technology and creativity. I enjoy exploring how programming, visual design, and artistic expression can come together—whether through software projects, creative coding, or experimental visuals.

I’m originally from **Shandong, China**, and I’m currently studying in **New York City**. I also have a cat named **小狗** 🐱 (yes, the name means “puppy”).
